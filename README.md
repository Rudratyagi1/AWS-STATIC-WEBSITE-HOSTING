## üìå **Project Overview**
This project demonstrates **static website hosting on Amazon S3** with **object-level ACLs and bucket policies** for enhanced access control and protection of critical files like `index.html`.

Key Highlights:
- **Hosted website** on an S3 bucket.
- **Enabled ACLs** to allow **public read access**.
- **Applied bucket policy** to **deny deletion of index.html**.
- **Learned troubleshooting for public access errors**.

## üéØ **Why These AWS Services?**
### **Amazon S3**
- **Why S3?**  
  - Highly durable, globally distributed storage (11 nines durability).
  - Eliminates server management vs. alternatives like Apache/Nginx.
- **Why not Azure Blob or Google Cloud Storage?**  
  - S3 has **best integration with AWS ecosystem** (IAM, CloudFront, Route53).
  - **Cheaper and simpler** static hosting vs. competitors.

### **ACL (Access Control List)**
- **Why ACL?**  
  - Allows **object-level public access**, essential for static websites.
- **Why not IAM alone?**  
  - IAM policies control AWS users/roles, not direct public access to objects.

### **Bucket Policy**
- **Why Bucket Policy?**  
  - Prevents unauthorized deletion of critical files.
- **Why not ACL alone?**  
  - ACL cannot define **explicit deny rules**.
